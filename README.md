# Nightingale

Nightingale is an everyday super app that protects women as they go about the day; be it the daily traveling in public transport, visiting new places or those late night meetings. 
This is a women safety app loaded with an array of features that takes into account the vulnerable points where pre-existing safety provisions prove to be inadequate. We aim to bridge the gap among and between people as well as the authorities to ensure the safety of women.

## Why Nightingale

This app centred around women security is bundled with a lot of awesome features. To higlight a few
* Providing SOS services in both network as well as NO NETWORK conditions.
* Using well defined algorithms and using actual datasets (Delhi crime rates of 2015) the user would get the safest route between 2 points.
* Providing heatmap so as to aid the user in avoiding places with high crime rates.
* Using secure authentication, to prevent any misuse of the app.
* Using external devices to send SOS signals to contacts given by the user.
